# Heatmap Generator
Python script to generate heatmaps based on the red color intensity in an image. This repository aims to help developers and researchers visualize and analyze the distribution of red color(or others colors) in images.

## Features
Red Heatmap Generation: The Python script uses the OpenCV library to read an image and resize it for processing. It then calculates the red color intensity for each pixel and generates a heatmap based on the intensity values.

Customizable Threshold: The script allows users to define a threshold value to determine which pixels are considered part of the heatmap. By adjusting the threshold, users can control the sensitivity of the heatmap generation.

Visualization and Comparison: The generated heatmaps are displayed using the OpenCV library's visualization capabilities. Users can compare heatmaps from different images or adjust parameters to observe changes in the heatmap representation.

Scalability: The script is designed to handle images of various sizes, automatically resizing them for processing while maintaining the aspect ratio.
